# videojs.ooyala.js

Video.js plugin to fetch videos from Ooyala. By supplying an Ooyala EmbedCode, the plugin will call the Ooyala API and fetch the video source of that EmbedCode.

## Demo

Run ```grunt``` on the project folder will serve up a server at ```localhost:3000/demo``` which provides a demo page.

## Usage

Include ```./dist/videojs.ooyala.js``` after video.js.

Enable the plugin once your player has been initialised:

```js
player.ooyala({
    playerBrandingId: (String), // Ooyala Player Branding ID (Required)
    pcode: (String),             // Ooyala Provider ID (Required)
    enableHls: (Boolean),        // Tweak force returning m3u8 from Ooyala if available (Optional)
    mobileProfile: (String)     // SAS profile to narrow down streams for mobile devices (Optional)
});
```

### Set an Ooyala video to the player:
If you want to set an Ooyala video to the player and prepare it for playback:

```js
player.ooyala.setSource(embedCode, callback);
// embedCode: (String) The Ooyala video EmbedCode (Required)
// callback: (Function) Returns the results of getVideoSource(), see below (Optional).
```

### Get video source from Ooyala
If you need to get the video source from ooyala for other use:

```js
player.ooyala.getVideoSource(embedCodes, callback);
// embedCodes: (String/Array) The Ooyala video EmbedCodes. Can be multiple videos. (Required)
// callback: (Function) Callback function once data is fetched. (Required)
```
Callback function will have `err` and `res` as argument, here is an example of callback results:

```javascript
{
    apiResponse: 'the complete response from the Ooyala API as a JSON object'
    videoUrls: {
        embedCode1: {
                authorized: 'true',         // If we are authorised to use this video
                src: 'Video URL',           // If authorised is true, this is defined.
                type: 'Video Type'          // If authorised is true, this is defined.
        },
        embedCode2: {
                authorized: 'false',
                message: 'Error Message',   // If authorised is false, this is defined.
                code: 'Error Code'          // If authorised is false, this is defined.
        }
    }
}
```
`src` and `type` are only set if `authorized` is true. You can then set these to the player, for example:

```js
player.ooyala.getVideoSource('myEmbedCode1, myEmbedCode2', function(err, res) {
    var videoResult = res && res['myEmbedCode1'];

    if (videoResult.authorized) {
      player.src({
          type: videoResult.type,
          src: videoResult.src
      });
    }
})
```

### Get the meta data of an Ooyala video
Ooyala videos have meta data that we can extract based on the embedCode.

```js
player.ooyala.getMetadata(embedCode, callback)
// embedCodes: (String/Array) The Ooyala video EmbedCodes. Can be multiple videos. (Required)
// callback: (Function) Callback function once metadata is fetched (Required)
```

Example:

```js
player.ooyala.getMetadata(embedCode, function(err, res) {
    console.log('metadata', embedCode, res);
})
```

## Player support

This plugin has been tested with:

- Video.Js 4.12.15
- Brightcove Perform Player v1.24.22

## IE Browser compatibility

This plugin uses the following functions so if you need support for a particular version of IE, you will need to implement a polyfill within your application.

| Function      | IE Version Supported  |
|-------------  |---------------------- |
| Object.keys   | IE9+                  |
| window.atob   | IE10+                 |
